Our community day will take place on Sunday June 3rd, and we will go for a trip together.<br>

Tour Description:<br>
Reykjanes is a peninsula in Southwest Iceland, characterized by immense lava fields, volcanoes and strong geothermal activity.<br>
The peninsula runs along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge where the Eurasian and the North American tectonic plates are drifting apart.<br>
Because of this geological setting, the whole peninsula is extremely volcanic active, covered with lava fields and volcanoes and small earthquakes are very common there.<br>
During the middle ages, many eruptions occurred in Reykjanes, but no eruptions have been recorded there for the last 500 years.<br>
