  During the workshop, we will discuss how to design stable, scalable, reliable and performant services.<br>
  Step by step, we will write a few services from scratch and prepare them for the deployment.<br>
  We will try continuous integration and continuous delivery.<br>
  At the end of the workshop, the participants will be able to run their own services on the prepared Kubernetes platform.<br>
  This platform will be available for a couple of weeks for further experiments and questions.<br>
  <br>
