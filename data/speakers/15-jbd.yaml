  Go is a great language to write servers. In a Go process, there are many activities going on, and it is not always easy<br>
  to observe the relationship between application-level code and runtime activities.<br>
  This limits our understanding of the runtime behavior and latency issues triggered by the application code.<br>
  Go is planning to extend its tools to provide more visibility and allow you to trace runtime events (such as goroutine<br>
  scheduling, memory allocation, GC, network events, and syscalls) related to application code.
