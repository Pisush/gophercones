talk: Observability-Driven Development
talkDescription: >
  <br>
  TDD is table stakes for any good team, but it's not enough: these days you need observability-driven design and development.<br>
  Tests are great but your code isn't baked til it touches real services, real data, real network hops, and real users,<br>
  and you should accept no substitute.<br>
  How can we safely roll software out and validate ourselves at every step, without inflicting subtle errors on our users?<br>
  What qualities of golang lend itself uniquely well to complex systems and distributed systems?<br>
  Where should you start when instrumenting golang code from scratch, and how should you anticipate the observability and<br>
  operability requirements of your systems?<br>
  What level of abstraction is useful?<br>
  We'll examine these techniques in the context of a few scenarios, such as the Parse API rewrite from ruby to golang,<br>
  and our experience at Honeycomb building and using golang SDKs for naive instrumentation of golang apps.
